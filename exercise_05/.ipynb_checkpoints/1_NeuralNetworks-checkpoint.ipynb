    "In this exercise, we will first take a closer look on the model side. In particular, you will implement self-contained building blocks that allow us to build complex models with ease. Afterwards, we will tackle the full pipeline once again, using new knowledge from our lectures to solve a more tricky task, i.e., general/non-binary classification. In particular, we will be using the CIFAR10 dataset that you developed in exercise 3 though we have to make some changes on the optimization and loss side in comparison to your toy example in exercise 4. \n",
